# Save PDF
This project automatically creates a PDF from the configured window

## Requirements
- [AutoHotKey v2](https://www.autohotkey.com/download/)
- [UIA-v2](https://github.com/Descolada/UIA-v2)

## Setup

### config.ini
Create a file `config.ini`. Use `config.example.ini` as a template.

Be sure to set the value of `windowTitle` as the title shown at the very top of your target application. For example, when you open Notepad, you'll see the text "Editor" at the top of the window.
